# PROJECT-MANAGEMENT-TOOL
This is my 5th task for the Encryptix internship, where I developed a project management tool using the MERN stack. The frontend was built with React, the backend with Express and Node.js, and MongoDB was used as the database.<br>
This project management tool allows you to create projects, assign tasks, and drag tasks between requested, todo, in-progress, and done sections.
<br>It also includes features such as deadlines and more. 
<br>
The website is working in localhost version only. For website click here. In the website problem is arising so localhost code is provided.
